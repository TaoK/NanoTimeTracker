
Nano TimeTracker
----------------

This is a simple .Net 2.0, WinForms C# app that sits in your system tray tracking 
the start and end of tasks you wish to log. There are already numerous time tracking
applications out there that do this, but in my (admittedly cursory) search I 
couldn't find any that are free and customizable, windows-native, and reduce the 
overhead to one click and a task name/description typed in.

This app is not really finished, many enhancements are possible and planned, most 
notably:
 - Overlapping time detection (on manual edit)
 - Autocomplete functionality in task name tracking
 - Hotkey functionality
 - Task category tracking
 - Tracking billability more easily
 - A more elegant and configurable data persistence mechanism
 - Options screen
 - Simple stats screen, export screen, etc
 - Computer idle time detection
